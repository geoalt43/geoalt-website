## The Hidden Layer Of The Funnel

Traditional funnels start with impressions clicks and traffic.

AI introduces a hidden layer that happens before all of that.

This layer decides which products are even mentioned when buyers ask questions.

If you are missing here nothing else matters.

## AI Does Not Discover Products It Inherits Consensus

AI systems do not explore new products on their own.

They summarize consensus from trusted sources.

If your product is not part of that consensus AI does not recommend it.

This explains why mature competitors often dominate AI answers even when better alternatives exist.

## Why Product Led Growth Needs AI Visibility

Product led growth assumes users will discover try and adopt your product organically.

AI changes discovery.

If AI never mentions your product users never try it.

This makes AI visibility a prerequisite for product led growth not a bonus.

## Authority Is Now A Growth Lever

Authority across editorial content reviews and communities directly impacts AI recommendations.

This authority is cumulative and compounds over time.

Brands that invest early build durable AI visibility.

Brands that ignore it struggle to enter conversations later.
