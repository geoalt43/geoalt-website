## The Buying Journey Has Already Changed

Today buyers no longer start with search results product pages or demo requests.

They start with a question to AI.

When a buyer asks ChatGPT for product recommendations the decision making process begins before your sales team ever enters the conversation.

If your product does not appear in the AI answer you are not considered.

## ChatGPT Is Not Evaluating Your Product

This is the uncomfortable truth for product marketers.

ChatGPT does not compare feature lists pricing pages or positioning statements from your website.

For shopping and recommendation questions it evaluates whether external data is required and then pulls information from trusted third party sources.

Those sources shape the answer.

## What Actually Influences AI Answers

AI systems rely on editorial articles expert reviews comparison guides and community discussions.

If these sources mention your competitors but not you the AI inherits that imbalance.

Your product may be better but AI never sees it.

This creates a visibility problem not a product problem.

## Why Traditional Product Marketing Is Not Enough

Great messaging strong positioning and polished landing pages do not matter if AI never encounters them.

AI does not browse your website first.

It summarizes what others have already said about you.

Product marketing now extends beyond owned channels into the ecosystem that influences AI.
