In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, a new paradigm is emerging: **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**. As users increasingly turn to AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude for answers, the traditional rules of SEO are being rewritten.

## What is GEO?

GEO goes beyond keywords and backlinks. It's about optimizing your content to be the authoritative source that Large Language Models (LLMs) cite when answering user queries. It's about visibility in the *generated answer*, not just a blue link on a results page.

### Why It Matters

- **Shift in User Behavior**: Users want direct answers, not a list of links.
- **Authority & Trust**: Being cited by an AI engine builds immense credibility.
- **Traffic Quality**: Users coming from AI recommendations are often higher intent.

## Key Strategies for AI Visibility

1.  **Entity Optimization**: Ensure your brand is clearly defined as an entity in the knowledge graph.
2.  **Citation Authority**: Build citations from sources that LLMs trust (e.g., reputable news sites, academic journals, niche industry publications).
3.  **Structured Data**: Use schema markup to help AI understand your content's context.
